== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does the complete badge cause little scroll arrows below the plugin? =

The complete badge is an image from colourlovers.com and is fairly wide.  If you're seeing scrollbars, your theme isn't wide enough to handle the badge width.  Try one of the other view options, like "show title".
